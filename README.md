# hello-world

My name is Aaron and I recently recieved my degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Purdue University. Currently working as a Database Administrator for QuEST Global but looking to go back to school to get my Master's in either Data Science or Business Intelligence.

A repository with my ideas and initial, common projects for different topics in Data science
This may include: 
-Iris data set for machine learning
-Titanic data set
-Scraping movie data
-Data wrangling case studies

NOTE: Some of these are projects that other people did. I am adding them to this repository for reference ONLY
